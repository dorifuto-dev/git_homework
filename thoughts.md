Study a lot!!
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

Throughout the homework assignments I have been testing different methods of Googling to find an answer when I'm stuck.
I will try to manage my time better and stick to the times I have allotted for studying code.

Shoutout to the Big Dawk Ralph in Florida. Stay Positive, test Negative brotha.ðŸ˜‚
